# Module System for Resizer Block
Adding blocks next to the resizer block will influence its operation
## Resizer block
By default the resizer block will create a 5 block radius sphere of effect around itself where the redstone input power will determine the resize effect.
## Resize Sender
This block in conjunction with a Resize Field Reciever will change where the resize field originates
## Resize Amplifier
This block will change the radius of the field using a menu

# Extra Blocks
These blocks will influence an existing resize field
## Resize Insulator
This block will create a column along the axis it is facing that stops the resize field when powered. Adjacent Resize Insulators will power each other if one is given a signal
## Resize Insulator Blocker
This block will prevent a resize insulator column from continuing
